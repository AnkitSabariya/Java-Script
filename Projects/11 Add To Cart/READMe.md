## ✨ How It Works

✔️ **Product Loading** → Pages fetch JSON, create product cards.

🛒 **Add to Cart** → Adds new item with `qty:1` or increases if exists → saves in LocalStorage.

💾 **Saved Cart** → Cart data always lives in LocalStorage — zero loss on refresh.

📦 **Cart Page** → Reads saved data → shows images, titles, unit price, quantity, total.

➕➖ **Quantity Control** → +/– buttons adjust (1–10), update LocalStorage & live total.

🗑️ **Remove One** → Removes item → updates LocalStorage & page.

🧹 **Clear Cart** → Wipes all items, empties LocalStorage, resets page.

📊 **Live Summary** → Subtotal + 18% tax + grand total update instantly.

✅ **One Source** → Single LocalStorage + dynamic DOM = real, user-friendly cart experience.
